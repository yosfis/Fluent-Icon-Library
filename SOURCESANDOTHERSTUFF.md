# SVGs
You can find some good SVGs for most icons and logos at *wikimedia commons* (`https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page`)  

If you don't find it there, check out *logopedia* (`https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/Logopedia` It's in a different language for some reason, but I'm sure you'll be able to navigate regardless)

If it's not there, you can search it on google.

If you have any extra suggestion sites, add them here. Any additions are appreciated
